Museum Image Clustering via K-means

1. I created clusters based on the following six variables in the dataset.
- has_text: image contains text?
- represenation - True if very realistic
- va: various degree bet. black & white
- te: texture 
- co: color (hue) 
- or: orientation, ranging from the vertical to the horizontal direction 

2. I chose 9 clusters, based on the elbow plot result and the silloutte analysis. 

3. Here are the curated "themes" I found in each of 9 clusters. 
My personal favorite is the 8th cluster (Cluster 7), which I named the "Deformation of squares". Here, the collected artworks seem to explore what we can recognize as "squares" and the visual elements that shape it.  
- Cluster 0: Bold Exploration of spatial dimension
- Cluster 1: Shades of the human mindset
- Cluster 2: Warm
- Cluster 3: Surreal caught between chaos and organization 
- Cluster 4: Exploration of dimensions, be it mental,imaginary or spatial
- Cluster 5: Abstract
- Cluster 6: Looking for the warmth 
- Cluster 7: Deformation of squares
- Cluster 8: Segmentation
